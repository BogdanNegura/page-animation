# Page-animation 

### Today we are going to learn how to do some javascript animations using GSAP. TweenMax is used to animate all the css properties with javascript and TimelineMax is used to chain together multiple animations and create sequences.
### If you want to add some animations to your website then I highly recommend you to follow along and implement it in your own projects. You can use this effect to create page transitions or page animations in general.
